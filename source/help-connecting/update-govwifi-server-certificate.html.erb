        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Update the GovWifi server certificate</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">Every 2 years or so, you’ll get a pop up message on your device asking you to accept a new GovWifi server certificate. This helps to keep GovWifi secure.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The pop up message will look different depending on what device you’re using. But as long as it says <strong>issued to: wifi.service.gov.uk</strong>, you can safely click <strong>ok</strong> or <strong>accept</strong> to install the new certificate.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if you cannot connect to GovWifi</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you cannot connect to GovWifi after accepting the new certificate, try:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>re-entering your GovWifi username and password</li>
          <li>restarting your device</li>
          <li>rejoining your GovWifi network</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if you get a thumbprint error message</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">A thumbprint (sometimes called a fingerprint) is used to validate the certificate, or to manage certificates on your devices. When you accept a new server certificate, your device might expect a different thumbprint.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you get an error message saying there’s a problem with your thumbprint or fingerprint:.</p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>View the Certificate details.
          <li>Check the certificate is called <strong>wifi.service.gov.uk</strong>.</li>
          <li>Check the certificate was issued by <strong>GeoTrust RSA CA 2018</strong>.</li>
          <li>Check that the Thumbprint matches the latest server certificate from 11 November 2019 - <strong>37:CE:B5:7A:3F:38:EB:7C:66:A2:4E:90:BB:11:71:D7:BC:4D:65:1A</strong>.</li>
          <li>Accept the new certificate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="govuk-body">You should now be able to connect to GovWifi.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What to do if you cannot accept the new certificate</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">If your device is managed by the organisation you work for, you might not be able to accept the new certificate.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Contact the IT support desk for the organisation you work for and ask them to trust or add <strong>DigiCert Global Root CA</strong> or <strong>GeoTrust RSA CA 2018</strong> for you.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your IT support desk might need access to the new certificates. They can download them from:</p>
